# YARRRML mappings with SAREF
 
This repository stores all the YARRRML and RML mappings used in the paper: "Making Heterogeneous Smart Home data Interoperable with the SAREF Ontology" by van der Weerdt, R., de Boer, V., Daniele, L., Nouwt, B. and Siebes, R., which is currently still in progress.

Also included are a small subset of the [OPSD household dataset](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/household_data/2020-04-15) and resulting graphs created by using the mappings with this small subset.
