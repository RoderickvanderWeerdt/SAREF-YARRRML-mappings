# YARRRML mappings with SAREF
 
This repository stores all the YARRRML and RML mappings used in the paper: "Making Heterogeneous Smart Home data Interoperable with the SAREF Ontology" by van der Weerdt, R., de Boer, V., Daniele, L., Nouwt, B. and Siebes, R.

Also included are a small subset of the OPSD household dataset and resulting graphs created by using the mappings with this small subset.
